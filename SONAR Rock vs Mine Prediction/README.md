# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify SONAR signals bounced off rocks or submarines (mines).

## Project Structure
- `ml_anbalysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for signal analysis and model building.
- `sonar.csv`: Dataset containing SONAR return frequencies.
- `saved_models/`: Directory for trained models.

## Usage
Run `ml_anbalysis.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.
