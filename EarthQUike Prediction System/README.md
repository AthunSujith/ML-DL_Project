# Earthquake Prediction System

## Overview
A machine learning project designed to analyze seismic data and predict potential earthquake occurrences.

## Project Structure
- `model_analysis.ipynb`: Data analysis and model building.
- `database.csv`: Historical earthquake data.
- `saved_models/`: Directory containing trained models.
- `layout.png`: System architecture or UI layout visualization.
- `req.txt`: Python package requirements.

## How to use
Install dependencies from `req.txt` and run the cells in `model_analysis.ipynb`.
