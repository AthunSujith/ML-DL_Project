# Dog vs Cat Classification using Transfer Learning

## Overview
This project classifies images of dogs and cats using deep learning. It leverages Transfer Learning with a pre-trained CNN model to achieve high accuracy.

## Project Structure
- `dl.ipynb`: Main notebook for transfer learning implementation.
- `cnn.py`: Python script version for training.
- `best_model.h5`: The best trained model saved during training.
- `dog-cat-full-dataset/`: Directory containing the image datasets.
- `req.txt`: Required Python packages.
- `logs/`: Training logs.

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies: `pip install -r req.txt`.
2. Ensure the dataset is present in the `dog-cat-full-dataset` folder.
3. Run `dl.ipynb` or `cnn.py`.
