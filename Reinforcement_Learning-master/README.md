# Reinforcement Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains various reinforcement learning algorithms implemented for different environments (CartPole, Pong, BipedalWalker, LunarLander).

## Projects
- **01-06 CartPole**: Implementations ranging from standard DQN to D3QN with CNN.
- **07-11 Pong**: Implementations including DQN CNN, Policy Gradient, A2C, A3C, and PPO.
- **BipedalWalker & LunarLander**: PPO implementations.

## Installation
Install dependencies via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
