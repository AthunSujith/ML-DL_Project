# Face Mask Detection

## Overview
This project uses Deep Learning to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask in real-time or from images.

## Project Structure
- `dl_model.ipynb`: Notebook for training the detection model.
- `face_mask_model.h5`: Pre-trained Keras model for face mask detection.
- `archive/`: Dataset containing images with and without masks.
- `req.txt`: Required dependencies.

## Usage
Install dependencies and run the `dl_model.ipynb` notebook.
