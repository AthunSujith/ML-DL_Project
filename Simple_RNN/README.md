# Simple RNN Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implementation for sequence modeling.

## Project Structure
- `rnn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the RNN implementation.
- `.venv/`: Virtual environment directory.

## Usage
Open `rnn.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment to explore the RNN model.
