# BigMart Sales Data Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales for BigMart outlets based on various product and store attributes. It uses machine learning techniques to help BigMart understand the properties of products and stores which play a crucial role in increasing sales.

## Project Structure
- `All_ML_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `Train.csv`: The training dataset with target variables.
- `Test.csv`: The test dataset for making predictions.
- `saved_models/`: Directory where trained models are stored.

## How to Use
1. Open `All_ML_Model.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
3. Run the cells to process the data and train the models.
